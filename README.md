# Magazine PDF Extractor

A fully automated system that extracts articles from heterogeneous magazine/newspaper PDFs into canonical XML with 99.9% field-level accuracy, featuring self-healing capabilities and zero human intervention.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Dual-Pass Architecture**: Layout-aware language models create semantic graphs, then traverse them to reconstruct articles
- **99.9% Accuracy**: Field-level accuracy with automatic quality assurance
- **Self-Healing**: Continuous evaluation with synthetic gold sets and automatic fine-tuning when drift is detected
- **Zero Human Touch**: No manual QA or approval steps; outputs are automatically quarantined if accuracy drops below threshold
- **Brand Agnostic**: All brand-specific quirks expressed as YAML configurations, not code
- **CPU/GPU Flexible**: Designed for both CPU and GPU deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of three core services:

### 1. Orchestrator Service (`services/orchestrator/`)
- **Purpose**: Central workflow coordination and job management
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Job queue management and workflow state
  - PDF ingestion and validation
  - Inter-service communication
  - Export pipeline (XML/CSV generation)

### 2. Model Service (`services/model_service/`)
- **Purpose**: AI/ML models for content extraction
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, PyTorch, Transformers, Tesseract, OpenCV
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Layout analysis using LayoutLM
  - OCR processing (born-digital + scanned)
  - Article reconstruction via graph traversal
  - Contributor extraction with NER
  - Image extraction and caption linking

### 3. Evaluation Service (`services/evaluation/`)
- **Purpose**: Accuracy evaluation, drift detection, and auto-tuning
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, NumPy, Pandas
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Accuracy evaluation against gold standards
  - Drift detection and trend analysis
  - Auto-tuning parameter optimization
  - Gold set management and synthetic augmentation

### Using the API

Upload and process a PDF:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@sample_magazine.pdf" \
     -F "brand=economist"
```

Monitor job progress:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}"
```

## üìã Processing Pipeline

1. **Ingestion**: PDF validation and metadata extraction
2. **Preprocessing**: Page splitting and preparation
3. **Layout Analysis**: LayoutLM-based block classification and semantic graph creation
4. **OCR**: Text extraction (direct from born-digital, Tesseract for scanned)
5. **Article Reconstruction**: Graph traversal to rebuild complete articles
6. **Contributor Parsing**: NER-based name and role extraction
7. **Image Extraction**: Image extraction with spatial caption linking
8. **Export**: XML/CSV generation following canonical schema
9. **Evaluation**: Accuracy assessment and drift detection

## üéØ Accuracy & Quality

### Accuracy Definition
- **Title match**: 30% weight (exact match after normalization)
- **Body text**: 40% weight (WER < 0.1%)
- **Contributors**: 20% weight (name + role correct)
- **Media links**: 10% weight (correct image-caption pairs)

### Quality Thresholds
- **Issue Pass**: ‚â• 99.9% weighted accuracy
- **Brand Pass**: 95% of last 10 issues pass
- **Auto-tuning Trigger**: 2 consecutive issues below 99.9% OR brand pass rate < 95%

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Brand Configuration Example (`configs/brands/economist.yaml`)

```yaml
brand: economist
layout_hints:
  column_count: [2, 3]
  title_patterns: ["^[A-Z][a-z]+.*", "^The.*"]
  jump_indicators: ["continued on page", "from page"]
ocr_preprocessing:
  deskew: true
  denoise_level: 2
confidence_overrides:
  title: 0.95
  body: 0.92
```

### Processing Configuration (`configs/processing.yaml`)

Global settings for OCR, layout analysis, article reconstruction, and quality thresholds.

## üîÑ Self-Healing System

### Drift Detection
- Evaluates every processed issue against synthetic gold set
- Rolling 10-issue window tracks accuracy trends
- Triggers auto-tuning on accuracy degradation

### Auto-Tuning Process
1. **Isolate failing patterns** from quarantined issues
2. **Generate targeted synthetic examples**
3. **Tune parameters** on synthetic set
4. **Validate** on holdout set
5. **Deploy** if accuracy improves, rollback if not

### Tunable Parameters
- Graph traversal rules (YAML configs)
- Confidence thresholds per field
- Block classifier prompts
- OCR preprocessing parameters

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics Available
